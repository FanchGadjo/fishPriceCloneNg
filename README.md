# Angular Tailwind Starter

This is a starter repo for Angular 8 projects that uses Tailwindcss.

## Getting Started

```
git clone https://github.com/wbroberts/angular-tailwind-starter.git
cd angular-tailwind-starter
npm install
npm start
```

## Tailwindcss

`npm run tailwind`

Tailwind builds a styles.tailwind.css file in the src/ directory. The generated css is huge, so when the application is built all of the unused css is purged.

## Purgecss

`npm run purge`

Purge css is ran when the application gets built. The default runs on the compiled code that is generated by Tailwind (styles.tailwind.css). All other css files are ignored.

## Prettier with Husky

There is a prettier pre-commit hook that is hooked up by default. To turn it off just erase the Husky part of the package.json. To adjust the prettier config just make changes to the .prettierrc file.
